# javascript-starter

It's a starter "theme" for writing Javascript for your project,
it's partially written in ES6 (use babel to compile into ES5)
Please use grunt to compile, minimize and uglify.


Grunt snippets:

var jsVendorList = [
    'assets/js/vendor/jquery/jquery.min.js'
];

// IMPORTANT this is the structor of includes, that will be compiled to the script file
// if you don't wanna use grunt, you can still use this structure and just concat and minify
var jsFileList = [
    'assets/js/custom-plugins/_*.js',
    'assets/js/modules/*.js',
    'assets/js/apps/*.js',
    'assets/js/_*.js',
];



concat: {
    options: {
        separator: ';'
    },
    dist: {
        src: [jsVendorList, jsFileList],
        dest: 'assets/js/scripts.js'
    },
},
uglify: {
    options: {
        compress: {
            drop_console: true
        }
    },
    my_target: {
        files: {
            'assets/js/scripts.min.js': ['assets/js/scripts.js']
        }
    }
},


babel: {
    options: {
        compact : true
    },
    dist: {
        files: {
            'assets/js/scripts_es5.js' : 'assets/js/scripts.js'
        }
    }
},
